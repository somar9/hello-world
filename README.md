# COntextualisation

Travel and Tourism
Some benefits with contextualisation is that computers will be able to recognise landmarks once they have been mapped on, so can allow for programs on phones that can give tours to tourists from their very own phones. However, it seems that it may not be able to clearly show something that the user is looking for if it was in a large crowd, for example, or blocked by other objects, so recognition may not be effective.
Gaming and entertainment
The abilityy to recognise objects, including people, allows for the expansion of the gaming industry, as cameras can now track the movment of people, which can use their movments as inputs for a game, and can use this to interact with a digital world within the game, but the movement may not be smooth or can not be tracked properly, causing the experience to not be as seamless and clunky.
Education and Learning
this technology can help accelerate learning for younger children. The recognition can allow children to learn Contextually to the world around them as they are interacting with them, allowing for quicker learning. IF the recognition, is off, it might cause the technology to give the children incorrect information, negatively impacting thier learning experoence.
Transport and navigation

The risk of this going wrong is that it may cause accidents when their are errors or faults, so lives are at the risk here.
Medicine and Healthcare
Computers can use this tehnology to identify illnesses or diseases, increasing efficiency for the NHS, and can allow for more patients to be seen in the same amount of time. Incorrect diagnoses can lead to many implications, including wasted time as patients mey have to be rediagnosed, other sicknesses from wrong medicines and more.
